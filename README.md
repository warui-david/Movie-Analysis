# Movie-Analysis

If you are like me, you struggle to find movies on these streaming services. There are just so many options available, so many thumbnails and movie covers splashed across the screen, each one seeming more interesting to look at than the previous one. So I spend an eternity trying to decide what to watch, and when I finally settle on one, I get bored too early into the movie, which I then abandon and the cycle continues. 
In this project, I analyze some of the top movie streaming services. Some insights I was looking to derive from this project were the top movies and their genres and which streaming platforms are leading in movie ratings.
